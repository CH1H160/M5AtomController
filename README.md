## Overview
What kind of controller do you usually use? There are many for PC and games. And now most of them are wireless.
It's very convenient, but it has its problems. For example, at an exhibition hall, bad reception. :weary:

This work can solve such problems. Wireless communication is usually performed with ESP-NOW, and it is possible to immediately switch to serial communication simply by connecting USB.
This is a controller that supports many "Makers" :smiley:

## BOM
If you own a 3D printer, print it yourself. 
FYI, if you don't have one, you can order it at JLCPCB, etc.
